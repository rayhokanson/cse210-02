# Pong
Pong is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis. The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen. They can compete against another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth.

## Rules
Pong is a two player game, player A on left and player B on right.

* Both players only move up and down by pressing key ‘Up’ and ‘Down’ for player A, key  ‘w’ and ’s’ for player B.
* Player scores if they get the ball past the other player.
